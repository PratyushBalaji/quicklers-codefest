      <h3>
       Cancer is a disease that often goes unnoticed till its too late. By the time cancer is finally detected it is at a fatal stage that almost certainly results in death. Although cancer treatment is slowly improving, the doctor to patient ratio is 1:1000 in India. T
      his shows that majority of patients do not get any treatment or even diagnosis at all. 
      The lack of doctors and treatment for the general public is not only due to the scarcity of treatment but also due to the fact that most people can not afford the full cost for treatments let alone diagnosis. By creating a decentralized solution we allow for anyone and everyone to access a diagnosis at any point.
